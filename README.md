It looked like a normal early morning mail delivery to you. Very boring, but pays the bills. But this time, you need to deliver letters into the neighborhood which you never visited before. Be prepared to never be the same.

Gameplay ~ 7 minutes.

Don't worry, it's not just about clicking on boxes. :smirk: 

## How to play

* Look at your task in the left upper corner, it will tell you what to do.
* All buildings have numbers on them.
* Click on the boxes in order to throw a mail or magazine into the box.
* All boxes on the building must be filled.

### Controls

* `WSAD`: Move like in all 3D first person games.
* `Left click`: Interaction with items.
* `Escape`: Toggle pause menu. Focus on HTML5 on Itchio is not perfect, so if you're playing HTML5 version, press `Esc` twice and click on the `Continue` button with your mouse to focus it back properly.
  * You can turn the sound and music off in pause menu as well, if you want to.
* `Shift (hold)`: Sprint.
* `Space`: Jump.

## My commentary
My second 3D LD game! It's interesting that when I work with 3D, I almost never run into any serious issues. This time, I tried the fog, better grouping, better everything! That said, I don't think I beat my previous entry. I went a little bit overboard and kept the scope a little bit too big, but I am still pretty happy with result.
